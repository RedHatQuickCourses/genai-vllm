= vLLM Serving Runtime

Before deploying any model, ensuring the correct serving runtime is available is paramount. The **vLLM NVIDIA GPU ServingRuntime** is the necessary integration between Red Hat OpenShift AI and the model inference.

This page outlines the runtimes included in a recent version of OpenShift AI and provides instructions to add the vLLM runtime manually if you are using an older version.

== Model Serving Runtimes

Red Hat OpenShift AI (like v2.21) includes several powerful runtimes out-of-the-box:

* *Multi-model*
** OpenVINO Model Server
* *Single-model*
** OpenVINO Model Server
** Caikit Standalone ServingRuntime for KServe
** Caikit TGIS ServingRuntime for KServe
** vLLM NVIDIA GPU ServingRuntime for KServe
** vLLM Intel Gaudi Accelerator ServingRuntime for KServe
** vLLM AMD GPU ServingRuntime for KServe
** vLLM CPU ServingRuntime for KServe

If the **vLLM NVIDIA GPU ServingRuntime for KServe** is already available, manual configuration is unnecessary.

=== Adding Custom Runtimes: 

If an older version of OpenShift AI is used and vLLM is not default, it can be added as a custom runtime through the OpenShift AI dashboard's `Settings` -> `Serving runtimes`.


[NOTE]
====
While OpenShift AI supports the ability to add your own runtime, you are responsible for configuring, adjusting, and maintaining any custom runtimes you deploy.
====

== Exercise: Add the vLLM Custom Runtime

If your environment does not include the vLLM runtime by default, this exercise will guide you through the steps to add it as a custom runtime.

[WARNING]
====
If you are using OpenShift AI v2.21 or newer, adding this runtime using the exact name below will fail, as it is already built-in. This exercise is intended for older versions.
====

. Log in to the OpenShift AI dashboard with an administrator account.

. In the left navigation menu, navigate to *Settings* -> *Serving runtimes*.

. Click the *Add serving runtime* button.

. On the "Add model-serving runtime" page, make the following selections:
+
--
* **Model-serving platform:** Select *Single-model serving platform*.
* **API protocol:** Select *REST*.
--

. Click the *Start from scratch* radio button.

. In the YAML editor that appears, paste the following configuration:
+
.vllm-servingruntime.yaml
