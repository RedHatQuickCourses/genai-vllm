= Deploy Granite LLM on RHOAI


With the model files uploaded and the vLLM runtime available, the next step is to deploy the LLM itself using OpenShift AI's serving capabilities.

**Steps for Model Deployment:**

 *   **Access Model Serving Options**: From the Data Science Project dashboard, 

 ** navigate to the `Models` tab, where `Single Model Serving` and `Multi-Model Serving` options are available. 
 ** For this lab, `Single Model Serving` is used.

 *   **Specify Deployment Details**:
    **   **Model Deployment Name**: This name (e.g., `granite`) becomes the exposed name of the model service.
    **   **Serving Runtime**: Select the `vLLM NVIDIA GPU servingRuntime Kserve`.
    **   **Framework**: For this runtime, the framework should auto-populate as `vLLM`.
    **   **Number of Model Replicas**: Due to video card requirements for the lab, keep this set to **one**.
    **   **Model Size (T-shift size)**: Options include Small, Medium, Large, or custom. For the lab, the `Large` option is chosen.
    **   **External Route and Authentication**: **Check the box to make the deployed model available through an external route**, which automatically selects requiring token authentication. A custom service account can be set for easier logging and metrics tracking.
    **   **Source Model Location**: Select the existing data connection (models) and specify the subdirectory where the model files reside (granite).
    **   **Additional Serving Runtime Arguments**: Optionally, add arguments to execute when loading the model for inference.
  *   **Deployment Process**: Clicking `deploy` initiates the process. Model deployment can take time as large model files are copied from S3 into the container before they can start.

[NOTE]
It's important to note that this name is the name of the model service that will be exposed. 
if you connect to the model, it will be known as granite only, not the full model name.
