= Lab Environment Customization

The initial phase of any AI deployment involves preparing the underlying infrastructure. For this course, a pre-provisioned lab environment is utilized, requiring specific customization and updates to ensure compatibility with modern vLLM runtimes.


== Key Actions for Engineers:

*   **Environment Preparation**: It is highly recommended to **request the lab environment in advance** due to an approximate deployment time of 1.5 to 2 hours.
*   **Platform Upgrade**: The provided lab environment typically starts with Red Hat OpenShift AI v4.18, which includes an older vLLM runtime. To leverage the features and performance of a more recent vLLM runtime (e.g., v0.9.01 as of July 2025), it is **essential to upgrade the platform to Red Hat OpenShift AI v2.21 or later**.
*   **Upgrade Process**: The upgrade is managed by updating the "subscription channel" for the Red Hat OpenShift AI Operator, which instructs the operator to install a newer platform version. An interactive demonstration guides users through logging in, navigating to Installed Operators, and changing subscription settings.



=== Interactive Demo: Logging In and Upgrading OpenShift AI

The following interactive demonstration will walk you through the process of:

1.  Logging into the OpenShift Cluster.
2.  Navigating to the Installed Operators.
3.  Changing the subscription settings for the OpenShift AI Operator to initiate the upgrade.

Follow the on-screen prompts in the demo to complete the upgrade process.
