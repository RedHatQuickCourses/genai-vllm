= Project and Data Connection Setup

Now that our lab environment is running an updated version of Red Hat OpenShift AI, the next step is to configure a project. This project will serve as our workspace and contain all the resources we create, including data connections and model servers.

We will proceed through the following key steps:

. Create a Data Science Project to house our work.
. Deploy a MinIO instance to act as our S3-compatible object storage.
. Configure storage buckets within MinIO for our models and pipelines.
. Create Data Connections in OpenShift AI to link our project to the MinIO buckets.
. Initialize the Data Science Pipeline server.

---

== Step 1: Create a Data Science Project

In OpenShift AI, a project is the fundamental organizational unit that provides a boundary for your resources. It is equivalent to a Kubernetes namespace and allows for user access control and resource allocation, enabling a self-service MLOps workflow.

After logging into the Red Hat OpenShift AI dashboard:

1.  Select **Data Science Projects** from the left navigation menu.
2.  Click **Create data science project**.
3.  Enter a **Name** for your project. For example, `vllm-lab` or as shown in the example below `Innovatech`.
    
[NOTE]
It is a best practice to use lowercase letters and hyphens for project names, avoiding spaces or uppercase characters.

4.  Optionally, provide a *Description*.
5.  Click **Create**.


== Step 2: Deploy S3 Compatible Storage (MinIO)

Our project needs a place to store large files like trained models and pipeline artifacts. For this lab, we will deploy MinIO, a high-performance, S3-compatible object store, directly into our OpenShift cluster.

[WARNING]
====
This deployment uses the community version of MinIO and is intended for lab and prototyping purposes only. It should not be used in a production environment. Red Hat does not provide support for MinIO.
====

To deploy MinIO, we will use the OpenShift web console to import a YAML configuration file.

. From the OpenShift console dashboard (not the OpenShift AI dashboard), select the project you just created (e.g., `vllm-lab`) from the project dropdown menu.
. Click the **+ Add** icon in the top navigation bar.
. On the **Import YAML** screen, paste the entire MinIO deployment configuration provided below.
. Click **Create** to deploy all the MinIO resources.

.Click to view and copy the MinIO deployment code.
