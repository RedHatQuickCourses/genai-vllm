= From Curation to Confident Deployment

This module has provided a strategic guide to navigating the complex world of open-source model selection. We began by addressing the challenge of finding reliable, enterprise-ready models in a vast ecosystem. We then introduced the Red Hat AI Validated Model Repository as a curated solution that provides confidence, predictability, and cost-efficiency for your AI projects.

Through in-depth analysis, we explored how Red Hat validates models, the critical role of quantization, and how to select a model based on its specific architecture, performance, and intended use case.

=== Key Concepts Revisited

Let's recap the core ideas from this module:

* **The Value of Curation:** A curated repository like Red Hat AI's is not just a list of models; it's a solution to de-risk projects by providing models that have been pre-vetted for performance, accuracy, and enterprise readiness.

* **Validation Breeds Confidence:** The rigorous validation process, using tools like `GuideLLM` and `LM Eval Harness`, provides the transparent data needed to make informed decisions and set realistic expectations for model performance on your target hardware.

* **Quantization is the Key to Cost-Efficiency:** Reducing a model's precision is the most effective strategy for fitting powerful models onto cost-effective hardware. We explored the trade-offs between the main strategies: FP8, INT8, and INT4.

* **A Hardware-Aware Strategy is Essential:** The most effective optimization strategies align the model's quantization with the GPU's native capabilities (e.g., leveraging FP8 support on Hopper, Ada, and Blackwell architectures).

As you approach your next AI deployment project, apply these practical lessons:

* **Start with a Validated Repository:** Before diving into the thousands of models on Hugging Face, begin your search with a curated source like the Red Hat AI repository. This will save significant time and reduce the risk of choosing an unsuitable model.

* **The "Model Card" is Your Best Friend:** The detailed analysis provided for each validated model is your primary decision-making tool. Use the benchmark data, especially the accuracy recovery scores, to understand the real-world trade-offs of using a quantized model.

* **Match the Quantization to the Job:**
    * **Need maximum speed with high accuracy on modern hardware?** Look for **FP8** models.
    * **Need a solid balance of performance and savings on a wide range of GPUs?** **INT8** is a reliable choice.
    * **Need to fit the largest possible model into a tight memory budget?** **INT4** provides the highest compression.

* **Think in Terms of TCO (Total Cost of Ownership):** Use the performance and efficiency data from the validated models to justify your hardware selections and model choices to stakeholders. Frame your decisions around performance-per-dollar and "Queries Per Dollar" to demonstrate clear business value.

=== Next Steps: Hands-On Deployment and Evaluation

You now have the theoretical foundation and analytical framework to select models with confidence. In the final module of this course, we will move into the hands-on labs.

You will take the three models we analyzed—`Mistral-Small`, `Qwen2.5-VL`, and `gemma-3`—and deploy them using vLLM on OpenShift AI. This practical experience will allow you to see firsthand how their different scales, modalities, and quantization strategies behave in a live environment, solidifying the concepts learned throughout this course.
