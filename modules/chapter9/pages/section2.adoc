= Lab Environment Customization

Welcome to the hands-on portion of the course. This section details the first steps required to configure your personal lab environment for deploying models with vLLM.

[IMPORTANT]
.Lab Environment Deployment Time
====
The lab environment used for this course takes approximately **1.5 to 2 hours** to deploy. It is highly recommended that you requested your environment *before* starting this section to avoid a lengthy delay.

*If you have not yet requested your lab environment, please do so now.* The provisioning system will send you an email notification once it is ready.

* If you prefer to wait for your environment, you can proceed with the reference material.
* If you wish to continue without a hands-on lab, this course includes interactive demos that provide a visual walkthrough of the required steps.

== Upgrading Red Hat OpenShift AI

The provided lab environment comes with a pre-installed version of Red Hat OpenShift AI. However, to work with the features and performance of a more recent vLLM runtime, we first need to upgrade the platform to a newer version.

The installed version is based on OpenShift 4.18 and includes an older vLLM runtime. Our goal is to upgrade to **Red Hat OpenShift AI v2.21 or later**, which provides vLLM runtime version 0.4.1 (as of July 2024), bringing it closer to the latest community releases and ensuring better compatibility.

The upgrade process is handled by updating the "subscription channel" for the Red Hat OpenShift AI Operator. This tells the operator to pull down and install a newer version of the platform.

=== Interactive Demo: Logging In and Upgrading OpenShift AI

The following interactive demonstration will walk you through the process of:
1.  Logging into the OpenShift Cluster.
2.  Navigating to the Installed Operators.
3.  Changing the subscription settings for the OpenShift AI Operator to initiate the upgrade.

Follow the on-screen prompts in the demo to complete the upgrade process.
