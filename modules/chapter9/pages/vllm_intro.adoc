= Project and Data Connection Setup

With the OpenShift AI environment updated and configured, the next logical step is to establish the workspace and storage mechanisms for AI assets.

== Create a Data Science Project

The project serves as the **fundamental organizational unit** for Openshift AI resources, equivalent to a Kubernetes namespace. It enables user access control and resource allocation, fostering a self-service MLOps workflow. Project names should ideally use lowercase letters and hyphens.

After logging into the Red Hat OpenShift AI dashboard:

1.  Select **Data Science Projects** from the left navigation menu.
2.  Click **Create data science project**.
3.  Enter a **Name** for your project. For example, `vllm-lab` or as shown in the example below `Innovatech`.
4.  Enter an optional description for the project
5. Click or select *"create".*


== Deploy S3-Compatible Storage (MinIO): 

Large files, such as trained models and pipeline artifacts, require dedicated storage. MinIO, a high-performance S3-compatible object store, is deployed directly into the OpenShift cluster for lab and prototyping purposes.


[WARNING]
====
This deployment uses the community version of MinIO and is intended for lab and prototyping purposes only. It should not be used in a production environment. Red Hat does not provide support for MinIO.
====

To deploy MinIO, we will use the OpenShift web console to import a YAML configuration file.

. From the OpenShift console dashboard (not the OpenShift AI dashboard), select the project you just created (e.g., `vllm-lab`) from the project dropdown menu.
. Click the **+ Add** icon in the top navigation bar.
. On the **Import YAML** screen, paste the entire MinIO deployment configuration provided below.
. Click **Create** to deploy all the MinIO resources.

.Click to view and copy the MinIO deployment code.

== Final Steps

 *   **Configure Storage Buckets**: Within MinIO, it's a required practice to create specific subdirectories (e.g., `models` bucket) for model files, rather than storing them in the root.

 *   **Create Data Connections**: These connections link your OpenShift AI project to your MinIO buckets, making it easy for workbenches and model servers to access stored data.

 *   **Initialize Pipeline Server**: A pipeline server is set up to support data science pipelines within the project.
