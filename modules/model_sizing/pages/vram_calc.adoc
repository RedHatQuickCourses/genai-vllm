= Summary for AI Platform Delivery Engineers: Actionable Insights

As an AI platform delivery engineer, your success in deploying LLMs cost-effectively on OpenShift AI hinges on:

==  **Accurate VRAM Planning:** 

Don't just consider model weights. **Factor in the KV Cache, system overhead, and activations** to get a true VRAM estimate. The KV cache, driven by batch size and context length, can easily exceed model weights, making **vLLM's PagedAttention a critical technology**.


==   **Cost-Aware Hardware Selection:** 

For PoCs, **target the 24 GB VRAM GPU tier** (e.g., L4, g6.4xlarge) as the sweet spot for performance-per-dollar.

==   **Prioritize Quantized Models:** 

Actively **seek out and test quantized versions of LLMs**. A quantized 13B model can be more cost-effective than a non-quantized 7B model.

==  **Leverage GPU Architecture Features:**
    **   If using **Hopper (H100) or Blackwell (B100/B200) GPUs, ensure your serving framework (like vLLM) utilizes the Transformer Engine** for automatic performance boosts.
    **   **Align your quantization strategy with the GPU's native precision support.** For Hopper/Blackwell, **strongly prefer FP8 quantization**. For Ampere, focus on BF16 or structural sparsity.
    **   Understand that HBM and NVLink are key enablers for low latency and efficient multi-GPU deployments.


**Always Profile:** The **"Golden Rule"** is to **profile your specific use case** with realistic loads to validate VRAM consumption and performance.
