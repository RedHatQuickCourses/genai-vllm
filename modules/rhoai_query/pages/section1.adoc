== Open JupyterLab 

JupyterLab enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner.

 . When the new window opens, use the OpenShift admin user & password to login to JupyterLab. 

 . Click the *Allow selected permissions* button to complete login to the notebook.


[NOTE]
If the *Open* link for the notebook is grayed out, the notebook container is still starting. This process can take a few minutes & up to 20+ minutes depending on the notebook image we opted to choose.


== Inside JupyterLab

This takes us to the JupyterLab screen where we can select multiple options / tools / to begin our data science experimentation.

Our first action is to clone a git repository that contains a collection of jupyter notebooks including the notebook we are going to use to query our deployed granite model. 


Clone the github repository to interact with the Jupyter notebook from this:

  https://github.com/RedHatQuickCourses/genai-apps.git

 . Copy the URL link above

 . Click on the Clone a Repo Icon above explorer section window.
